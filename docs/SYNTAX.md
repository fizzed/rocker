## Syntax

Rocker uses an intuitive, **tagless** syntax with standard Java expressions for
iteration, control, and values.  Templates consist of two parts - plain static
text and dynamic code.  Rocker's parser considers everything to be plain text
by default, but switches to dynamic mode when it sees the ```@``` character.  Rocker
infers when your dynamic code ends by tapping into Java's own rules for variable
names, methods, and general structure. The only other special characters are
curly brackets -- which are used to indicate the start and end of blocks. As long
as you make sure a left curly has a matching right curly, the only character
you will need to escape in your plain text is the @ char.

## Using literals @, }, and {

Since the ```@``` character indicates the start of dynamic code, to include it in your
plain text, simply escape it using ```@@```. If you find the need to escape the ```{``` or ```}```
characters, escape them using ```@{``` and ```@}```.  However, as long as you make sure your
left curly has a matching right curly, you will rarely ever need to escape them.

## Template Preamble

Each template starts with an optional preamble.  The preamble is where you define
Java imports, options, and arguments.  All of these are optional.  Your template
body is considered to begin after the last preamble statement.

### Import declarations (@import)

These are standard Java import statements that are added to the top of generated
Java source code.  These start with `@import` and end with a newline (do not end
them with a semi-colon).  Both static and wildcard imports are supported. Since
these are declared at the top of generated Java code, they apply to the template
arguments declaration for resolution.  Also, remember that other templates
are also placed into Java packages, so you can import other templates if you want
to shorten their syntax.

    @import java.util.*
    @import static java.lang.Math.*
    @import views.index

    @args (Map<String,String> map)

    @index.template()

### Option declarations (@option)

Options control how templates are parsed and generated. These normally
should be globally set (e.g. in the maven plugin configuration), but there are times
when setting them per-template is useful.  Any option can be set since the
option statement accepts a key=value syntax.  Here is a sample disabling
the discardLogicWhitespace and setting the target charset to something other
than the global default.

    @option discardLogicWhitespace=false
    @option targetCharset=UTF-16

    Hello!

A full list of options is below.

### Arguments declaration (@args)

A single arguments statement declares the parameters to the template. If this
statement is not included, then the template has no arguments.  However, we
generally find it's still helpful to include an empty list for readability sake.

    @import java.util.Map
    @import java.util.Date

    @args (Map<String,String> map, Date d)

    Hello!

## Template Body

The template body begins after the last preamble statement.  The body includes
a mix of plain static text and dynamic code.

### Value expressions (@value)

Outputs the value during the render. Rocker does not require you to explicitly
provide an end tag, the end of the expression is inferred from standard Java
constraints on variable/method names.  Let's say you have a User object with
a String property `getName()` that returns "John Smith".

    @args (User user)

    Name: @user.getName().substring(0, 4)

The value expression ```@user.getName().substring(0, 4)``` will return ```John```
since Rocker inferred the entire chained call was all part of the same expression.
All sorts of value expressions will work exactly as you would expect. You can
call static or instance methods, chained methods, and pass arguments.

### Null-safe value expressions (@?value)

Rocker will throw a `NullPointerException` if an expression evalutes to a null
during the rendering process.  As of v0.13.0 Rocker supports the `@?value`
syntax to skip rendering the value if its null.  Let's say you have a User object
with a String property `getName()` that returns null.

    @args (User user)

    Name: @?user.getName()

Rocker will render `Name:` and will skip rendering `user.getName()` since `getName()`
returned null.

### Null-safe ternary operator (@value?:other)

Rocker v0.13.0 supports a null ternary operator that either renders a value if
its not null or will render a default/fallback value instead.  Unlike Java 8's
`Optional`, Rocker allows the default/fallback value to be of an entirely different
type than the primary value.  Rocker also uses efficient assignment with short-
circuit semantics so that the default value won't be evaluated if the primary
value exists.  Let's say you have a User object with a String property `getName()`
that returns null.

    Name: @user.getName()?:"None"

Since `getName()` returned null then Rocker would render `None`.  Unlike value
expressions, Rocker supports values, strings, or literals as fallback values.

### Automatic escaping

Rocker will automatically escape any of your dynamic content based on the
template content type. Rocker determines the content type of a template by the
file extension of the template.  A template named `index.rocker.html` will have
a content type of HTML and HTML escaping will be used for any value expression.
Let's say you supply a string of `"<html>"` as the `element` value to the following
template.

```html
@args (String element)

@element
```

Since HTML escaping is in effect the actual rendered output is

```html
&lt;html&gt;
```

For the cases where you'd like to bypass these rules and directly render your
content, use the `@raw` method.

```html
@args (String element)

@raw(element)
```

The rendered output is

```html
<html>
```

### If- else if -else blocks (@if)

Standard Java if - else if - else control flow. The left curly character ```{``` indicates
the start of a block and the right curly character ```}``` marks the end.

The ```else if``` option is available as of v0.16.0.

If block with else example.

    @if (booleanVar) {
        i am in if block!
    } else {
        i am in else block!
    }
    
With ```else if```.

    @if (val.equals("abc")) {
        abc!
    }
    else if (val.equals("def")) {
        def!
    }    
    else if (val.equals("ghi")) {
        ghi!
    } 
    else {
        i am in else block!
    }    
    
Note that Rocker has intelligence to skip template content that includes ```{```
and ```}``` characters such as JavaScript or CSS.  You will not need to escape
these characters as long as you have matching left and right curly brackets.

### Switch - case - default blocks (@switch)

Standard Java switch - case - default control flow. The left curly character ```{``` indicates
the start of a block and the right curly character ```}``` marks the end.

Switch block with case and default example.

    @switch (s) {
        case ("a") { 
            i am in the "a" block
            @break
        }
        case ("b") {
            i am in the "b" block
            @break
        }
        default {
            i am in the "default" block
        }
    }

Without a default block.

    @switch (v) {
        case (1) { 
            i am in the "a" block
            @break
        }
        case (2) {
            i am in the "b" block
            @break
        }
    }

Without including an @break which could run multiple case statements just like standard Java.  If ```v``` was 1 then
both ```i am in the "a" block``` and ```i am in the "b" block"``` would be output.

    @switch (v) {
        case (1) { 
            i am in the "a" block
        }
        case (2) {
            i am in the "b" block
            @break
        }
    }

### Enhanced Switch - case - default blocks (@switch) JDK17+

Enhanced Java switch - case - default control flow. The left curly character ```{``` indicates
the start of a block and the right curly character ```}``` marks the end.

Switch block with case and default example.

    @switch (s) {
        case ("a") -> { 
            i am in the "a" block
        }
        case ("b") -> {
            i am in the "b" block
        }
        default -> {
            i am in the "default" block
        }
    }

Without a default block.

    @switch (v) {
        case (1) -> { 
            i am in the "a" block
        }
        case (2) -> {
            i am in the "b" block
        }
    }

The Difference from normal Switch block is that @break is not required and each case is separate from the other.

### With blocks (set one or more variables) (@with)

As of v0.12.0 a `@with` block sets a variable to a value within a scoped block. Once the block
exits the variable is no longer available. Variable names cannot conflict with
other variable names (e.g. arguments) and they will be checked by the Java compiler.

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @with (s = list.get(0)) {
        @s
    }

For Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @with (String s = list.get(0)) {
        @s
    }
    
As of v0.15.0 a @with block can set more than one variable within the scoped block. Once the block
exits the variables are no longer available. Variable names cannot conflict with
other variable names (e.g. arguments) and they will be checked by the Java compiler.

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @with (s1 = list.get(0), s2=map.get("key").subList(0,3)) {
        @s1
        @s2.get(0)
    }

For Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @with (String s1 = list.get(0), List<String> s2=map.get("key").subList(0,3)) {
        @s1
        @s2.get(0)
    }

### Null-safe with blocks (@with?)

As of v0.13.0 a `@with?` block with a `?` presence operator at the end will
function identical to a `@with` block no presence operator, but if the value
set is null, then the `@with` block will be skipped.  You can also define an
optional `} else {` block to be executed if the main `@with` block is skipped.
Let's say the `list` below at index 0 returns null:

    @with? (s = list.get(0)) {
        @name
    } else {
        None!
    }

Since `list.get(0)` returns null and the `?` presence operator was added to
`@with` then Rocker would end up rendering `None!`.  Null-safe with blocks are
incredibly powerful to add prefixes and postfixes to data that may or may not
exist.

Note: Nullsafe with blocks are not allowed if the with block has multiple arguments.
      Doing so will result in a compile error.

### Eval expression (@())

As of v0.13.0 a `@( )` expression will evaluate the expression between the
parentheses and then render the value.  The eval expression is a cousin to the
`@value` expression.  For example, if you iterating thru a loop with zero-based
indexes, the eval expression can let you easily increment the index by 1 and
render the value:

    @for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        @(i+1): @list.get(i)<br/>
    }

For a list with an item at 0 of "Joe" this would render `1: Joe<br/>`

### Iteration (@for)

Standard Java for loops as well as enhanced syntax for Java 6 & 7 and
fancier syntax for Java 8+ (where types are inferred).  Since iteration is such
an important part of rendering templates, Rocker provides support for a special
```ForIterator``` object that can be included with for-loops.

#### Rocker iterator

If you request an iterator, the index of current item

    @i.index()

If the item is the first

    @i.first()

If the item is the last
    
    @i.last()

#### Standard for-loop

    @for (int i = 0; i < items.size(); i++) {
        @items.get(i)
    }

#### Enhanced for-loop with Collection

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @for (item : items) {
        @item
    }

And for Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @for (String item : items) {
        @item
    }

#### Enhanced for-loop with Collection and Rocker iterator support

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @for ((i, item) : items) {
        @i.index(): @item
    }

And for Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @for ((ForIterator i, String item) : items) {
        @i.index(): @item
    }

#### Enhanced for-loop with Map

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @for ((key, item) : itemMap) {
        @key: @item
    }

And for Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @for ((String key, String item) : itemMap) {
        @key: @item
    }

#### Enhanced for-loop with Map and Rocker iterator support

For Java 8 (note this is statically typed and checked at compile time)

    @for ((i, key, item) : itemMap) {
        @key: @item (at index @i.index())
    }

And for Java 6/7 (Note: rocker v2.0.0 drops Java 6/7 support)

    @for ((ForIterator i, String key, String item) : itemMap) {
        @key: @item (at index @i.index())
    }

#### Java 8 Streams

As of Rocker v0.24.0, `@for` loops accept a `java.util.Iterator` as an
acceptable value to loop.  For looping against a `java.util.stream.Stream` of
data:

    @for (item : mystream.iterator()) {
        @item
    }

#### Break and continue

As of v0.10.2, iterations can break early with `@break` support

    @for ((i, item) : items) {
        @if (i == 2) {
            @break
        }
    }

As of v0.10.2, iterations can continue with `@continue` support

    @for ((i, item) : items) {
        @if (i == 2) {
            @continue
        }
    }

### Calling other templates

Templates can include other templates during its rendering process similar to
how you use them from Java. Other templates are resolved as normal classes
(e.g. packageName.className syntax).

A template can include another template

    @views.MyOther.template()

If that template requires arguments, then you simply pass them along

    @views.MyOther.template(myArg1, "Another arg")

If that template requires a ```RockerBody``` argument (more on this later), then
you can include it using a closure syntax after the template value expression

    @views.MyOther.template(myArg1, "Another arg") -> {
        i will be rendered in MyOther
    }

Or as of v0.10.1 call another template dynamically (by name, not class)

    @import com.fizzed.rocker.Rocker

    @Rocker.template("views/MyOther.rocker.html", "myArg1", "Another arg")

### Content blocks

Sometimes its useful to assign a block of content to a variable that can be
called in other places or even passed along to another template.

    @var => {
        content block
    }

    Hello, i am in the @var 

That template would render ```Hello, i am in the content block```.  Templates
can pass these to each other by declaring an argument of type ```RockerContent```.

    @args (RockerContent content)

    @content

### RockerBody

A ```RockerBody``` is a special type of ```RockerContent``` that let's a template
declare that it expects a content block passed to it when its included in
other templates.  The ```RockerBody``` must be the last variable declared in ```@args```.
While it functions identically to ```RockerContent```, it helps support a more
intuitive syntax for passing around the "body" of templates.  Let's say you
create a template ```views.Hello```

    @args (RockerBody body)
    
    Header
    @body
    Footer

Then in another template that includes it

    @args ()

    @views.Hello.template() -> {
        i am in the body
    }

This would render

    Header
        i am in the body
    Footer

## Comments (@* *@)

Server side comments can be used anywhere (preamble or body)

    @*
        I am a comment
    *@

## Options

The following options are supported in the preamble option statement.

### Discard logic whitespace

    @option discardLogicWhitespace=true

Helps make your template output look more professional by carefully removing
whitespace, but only in some circumstances.  This value is only enabled by
default for certain content types such as HTML.  The algorithm is as follows:

 - Discard any lines that are only whitespace up till the first line of non-whitespace
   text or an expression that would output a value.

 - Then discard lines consisting entirely of block-level logic such as if/else
   blocks, or content/value closures.  Lines that mix non-whitespace text and
   block-level logic will be skipped.

Without this feature enabled, Rocker and many other template engines render
HTML that includes blank lines due to server-side logic. The following is pulled
from twitter.com. Notice all the blank lines?  Clearly twitter has lots of 
server-side logic in those places.

```html


<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    

    <meta charset="utf-8">
```

With this feature enabled, Rocker can get you close to this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
```

This feature's goal is to not remove all whitespace, just the whitespace added
due to server-side logic that unfortunately adds extra newlines you really didn't
want rendered.

### Java version

    @option javaVersion=1.8

The Java version you'd like your templates be compile & runtime compatible with.
Defaults to the Java version of the JVM executing the parser (e.g. "1.8").
 
### Extends class

    @option extendsClass=com.sample.MyAppBaseTemplate

The class that all templates should extend. Useful for application-specific
intermediate classes that you'd like all templates to extend. Defaults to ```com.fizzed.rocker.RockerTemplate```

### Target charset

    @option targetCharset=UTF-8

The target charset for template output.  Defaults to UTF-8.  Accepts any value
that is supported by Java's standard charsetName.

### Post-Processing of Templates

    @option postProcessing=com.sample.MyTemlateModelPostProcessor

Post-processing of templates allows custom classes to perform compile-time 
transformation of the model your templates are parsed into before any Java
code is generated. See the section on Post-Processing below for details.

## Handling null values

We suggest using the ```Optional``` class either via Google Gauva for Java 6/7
or the standard class in Java 8.  With Rocker's syntax for value expressions,
the Java 8 optional prevents a NullPointerException as well as being readable.

    @Optional.ofNullable(myVar).orElse("None")

And if you don't like to type `Optional.ofNullable` -- consider using it in your 
objects as the return value.  If your object returns an `Optional`, then the syntax
is even more simplified

    @myVar.orElse("None")

## More functions please!

Rocker supports standard or wildcard Java imports via the `@import` declaration.
It also supports Java's static import -- which can be carefully used to make
other functions look like Rocker functions.  The following template makes
`java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis()` look like a Rocker template function

```html
@import static java.lang.System.currentTimeMillis

Current time in millis is @currentTimeMillis()
```

Use this technique sparingly since naming collisions of current or future
Rocker built-in features could occur. However, its a handy feature in some
circumstances.

## Building complex templates

Combining content chunks along with a RockerBody allow building complex templates
for rendering advanced content.  Here is an example demonstrating how a master
`main` template can be used to construct various sections.  Create a `views/main.rocker.html`
template.

```html
@args (String title, RockerContent extracss, RockerContent extrajs, RockerBody content)

<html>
<head>
    <title>@title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href='/assets/css/bootstrap.min.css' >
    @extracss
    <body>
       @content
    <script type="text/javascript" src='/assets/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js'></script>
    @extrajs
</body>
</html>
```

This master template can be used in a calling template. Create a `views/index.rocker.html`
template.
    
```html
@args ()

@extracss => {
    <link rel="stylesheet" href='/assets/css/main.css' >
}

@views.main.template("Home", extracss, RockerContent.NONE) -> {
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
}
```

This will result in rendering

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href='/assets/css/bootstrap.min.css' >
    <link rel="stylesheet" href='/assets/css/main.css' >
    <body>
       <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='/assets/js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js'></script>
   
</body>
</html>
```

## Post-Processing

Rocker supports custom post-processing of the model your templates are parsed into before
any Java code is actually generated for them.
Post-processing is a compile-time feature which does not take any dynamic evaluations
(e.g. method calls within your templates) into account.

To enable post-processing for your templates, either add the postProcessing configuration
to your pom.xml, and/or specify your post-processors using `@option postProcessing=...`

### Global Setup of Post-Processors with Maven
Provide a list of Post-Processor class names in your pom.xml to have these processors
being executed on every one of your models.
```xml
    <configuration>
    	<!-- ... other rocker configuration options -->
        <postProcessing>
            <param>com.fizzed.rocker.processor.LoggingProcessor</param>
            <param>com.fizzed.rocker.processor.WhitespaceRemovalProcessor</param>
        </postProcessing>
    </configuration>
</execution>
```

### Per-Template Setup of Post-Processors with @option
To setup post-processing for selected templates only, use the following option at the
beginning of your templates:
```
@option postProcessing=com.fizzed.rocker.processor.LoggingProcessor,com.fizzed.rocker.processor.WhitespaceRemovalProcessor
```

### Order of Execution

If post-processors are setup in both ways (i.e. through pom.xml <b>and</b> with the `@option`
directive, then the list of post-processors to run on the template will be the concatenation
of first all post-processors from pom.xml, and then all post-processors from the template.

Post-Processors are guaranteed to always execute in the order in which they were specified. 

### Multiple Calls to the same Processor

The same Post-Processor is allowed to run multiple times on the same template. To further
support this, each post processor is provided with a 'call index' during execution, which is
the index (starting with 0) of the active post-processor in the list of all post-processors 
to run.

However, post-processor instances are currently not reused. A new object is instantiated
whenever a post-processor is called. If you need to maintain some context between two
executions of post-processors, you could either use static fields, or amend the template
model by adding otherwise unused `Unit`s (e.g. `PlainText`).
